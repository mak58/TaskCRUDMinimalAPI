* First of all I modifyied the parameter string "Hello World" to a objet Json. ({Guid.NewGuid(), "walk to a pet", false})
* This data was injected by constructor of a "class" called by Tasks. I created a folder called Models. This class was modifyied to a record.
* The application was saved and played. It was possibly seeing the data into a Json file in a browser.
* The next step it was creating a Data folder and installed the packages Entity framework sqlite anda desing.
* In a migration step, happened this error (Não foi possível executar porque o comando ou o arquivo especificado não foi encontrado.)
* I solved the problem installing the .Net Run time.
